Our group's research addresses fundamental questions concerning the evolution and dynamics of the solid Earth
as revealed by geophysical data. The long-term objective of our research program is to constrain the
role of geological structure on the dynamics of active ocean-continent tectonic systems. For example, a lot of our active projects involve characterizing convergent and transform ocean-continent plate
boundaries and elucidating the growth and fate of large cordilleras. Our work if informed by robust statistical analysis and modelling of seismic and geophysical data collected from a number of sources. Our tools of predilection include the automated processing of large quantities of broadband seismic data obtained from public archives. We develop and make publicly available a lot of our numerical tools - check out the Software page. We also install our own seismic monitoring stations - check out the Field page. Soon we will go on boats too.
