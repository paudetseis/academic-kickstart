Our group's research addresses fundamental questions concerning the evolution and dynamics of the solid Earth
as revealed by geophysical data. The objective of our research program is to constrain the
role of geological structure on the dynamics of active ocean-continent tectonic systems. For example, a lot of our active projects involve characterizing convergent and transform ocean-continent plate
boundaries and elucidating the growth and fate of large cordilleras. Our work is informed by robust statistical analysis and modelling of seismic and geophysical data collected from a number of sources. Our tools of predilection include the processing of large quantities of broadband seismic data obtained from public archives. We develop and make publicly available a lot of our numerical tools - check out the [Software](#software) page. We also install our own seismic monitoring stations - check out the Field page.
