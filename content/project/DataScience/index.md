Modern trends in geophysical and seismic data analysis involve plowing through very large amounts of data to extract maximum information on Earth structures and processes. Our group's work has always been geared toward improving existing tools and developing new ones to maximize information extraction from large data sets. Additional examples of recent work include: 1) Using unconventional sources of seismic energy (i.e., anthropogenic noise) to obtain accurate and reliable measurements of spatio-temporal seismic velocity models in underground mines; 2) Harnessing modern statistical learning algorithms to characterize the full seismic wave field, classify earthquakes and subduction zone behavior, and perform improved automatic earthquake detections and locations; and 3) Implementing Bayesian algorithms to obtain reliable uncertainty estimate in geophysical inversions.
