We are happy to announce that our proposal for the study of the southern Hikurangi subduction zone has been fully supported. This project will involve deploying a fleet of 20 broadband OBS from the [NFSI](https://nfsi.ca) during one year to study the seismicity and seismic velocity structure in the locked zone of the Hikurangi margin that is thought to produce large megathrust earthquakes. The project is a collaboration between the University of Ottawa (Pascal Audet), Dalhousie University (Mladen Nedimovic), Victoria University of Wellington (Martha Savage) and GNS Science (Laura Wallace, Emily Warren-Smith, Katie Jacobs). 

The first deployment is scheduled for January 2023. Stay tuned for more info!
