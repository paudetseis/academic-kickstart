Next week our team of PIs, techs and students is heading to Wellington, New Zealand, to board the RV Tangaroa and deploy a fleet of 20 broadband ocean-bottom stations from the [NFSI](https://nfsi.ca) facility to study the locked zone of the Hikurangi subduction zone. Media stories and vlogs/blogs will follow soon!

This project is focused on studying the seismicity and seismic velocity structure in the locked zone of the Hikurangi margin that is thought to produce large megathrust earthquakes and tsunamis. The project is a collaboration between the University of Ottawa (Pascal Audet), Dalhousie University (Mladen Nedimovic), Victoria University of Wellington (Martha Savage) and GNS Science (Emily Warren-Smith, Katie Jacobs). The project is funded by the University of Ottawa, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and the EarthQuake Commission of New Zealand.

Stay tuned for more info!
