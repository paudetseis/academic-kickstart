The Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences at the University of Ottawa invites applications to fill two fully funded graduate positions (Ph.D. or M.Sc.) in the uOttawa Geophysics group (https://www.uogeophysics.com). The students will work on projects related to the study of lithosphere structure and dynamics at the Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction zone. Projects will involve processing and modelling seismic data collected at sea from the Earthquakes and Locking inVEstigation of Subduction (ELVES) project. The successful candidates will be expected to design and implement data-processing tools, combined with modern statistical learning methods, to investigate the seismic velocity structure of the crust and lithosphere in relation to seismogenesis at Hikurangi. There is financial support for overseas conference attendance and a potential research placement with colleagues in New Zealand.

The application deadline for the [graduate positions](/files/Advertisement_PhD_2026.pdf) is December 12, 2025, with a start date in September 2026 (preferred) or January 2027.

All inquiries and application packages should be directed to Prof. Pascal Audet (he/him) at pascal.audet@uottawa.ca
