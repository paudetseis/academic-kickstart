The uOttawa Geophysics Group invites applications for 2 PhD positions and 1 Postdoctoral position in marine seismology. The candidates will join an active research group in the design and implementation of novel seismic analysis techniques and development of open-source scientific software. Partial support will be provided by the [iMAGE-CREATE](https://solidearthgeoscience.org) graduate training program, with opportunities to participate in the activities of the program. The successful candidates will work on a number of projects in Marine Seismology related to the study of oceanic lithosphere structure and processes, in particular at tectonic plate boundaries, through seismic imaging. Potential research targets include the Hikurangi margin (New Zealand), the Cascadia subduction zone and the Queen Charlotte fault region. Projects may involve seismic data collection at sea using arrays of broadband ocean-bottom seismic instruments from the [NFSI](http://www.nfsi.ca) and other facilities.
