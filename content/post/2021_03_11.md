The uOttawa Geophysics Group invites applications for 2 PhD positions and 1 Postdoctoral position in marine seismology. The candidates will join an active research group in the design and implementation of novel seismic analysis techniques and development of open-source scientific software. The [iMAGE-CREATE](https://image-create.ca) graduate training program in Marine Geodynamics and Georesources will provide outstanding training opportunities, including participation in field trips and research cruises. The successful candidates will work on a number of projects in Marine Seismology related to the study of oceanic lithosphere structure and processes, in particular at tectonic plate boundaries, through seismic imaging. Potential research targets include the Hikurangi margin (New Zealand), the Cascadia subduction zone and the Queen Charlotte fault region. Projects may involve seismic data collection at sea using arrays of broadband ocean-bottom seismic instruments from the [National Facility for Seismic Imaging (NFSI)](http://www.nfsi.ca) and other facilities.
