Shoutout to Taylor and Quan who participated in the successful deployment of 20 broadband OBS stations offshore Wellington, New Zealand, to study the Hikurangi subduction zone! You can find the info on the project [here](https://www.eastcoastlab.org.nz/projects/science-projects/elves-earthquakes-and-locking-investigation-of-subduction/).

Taylor also wrote several blog pieces that detail the life and science aboard the R/V Tangaroa during the deployment:
