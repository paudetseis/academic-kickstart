The Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences at the University of Ottawa invites applications to fill two fully funded [graduate positions](/files/Advertisement_PhD_2025.pdf) (MSc or PhD) in the uOttawa Geophysics group (https://www.uogeophysics.com). The students will work on projects related to the study of lithosphere structure and dynamics at the Hikurangi (New Zealand) and Cascadia (western Canada) subduction zones. Projects may involve seismic data collection at sea using arrays of broadband ocean-bottom seismic instruments from the NFSI (http://www.nfsi.ca) and other facilities. The successful candidates will be expected to design and implement data processing tools combined with modern, statistical learning-based methods to investigate the seismic velocity structure of the lithosphere.

The application deadline for the [graduate positions](/files/Advertisement_PhD_2024.pdf) is December 9, 2024, with a start date in September 2025 or January 2026.

All inquiries and application packages should be directed to Prof. Pascal Audet (he/him) at pascal.audet@uottawa.ca

See [here](/files/Advertisement_PhD_2025.pdf) for more details.
