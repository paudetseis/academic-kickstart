The uOttawa Geophysics Group invites applications for 1 PhD position in marine seismology, co-supervised with the Dalhousie Geophysics group. The candidate will join an active research group in the design and implementation of novel seismic analysis techniques and development of open-source scientific software. The position is funded through the [iMAGE-CREATE](https://image-create.ca) graduate training program in Marine Geodynamics and Georesources, which provides outstanding training opportunities, including participation in field trips and research cruises. The PhD student will work on determining the seismicity and seismic velocity structure of the southern Hikurangi Margin offshore New Zealand, to constrain the factors controlling megathrust fault coupling and seismogenesis. This project involves data collection at sea using an array of broadband ocean-bottom seismic instruments from the NFSI (http://www.nfsi.ca), and the successful candidate is expected to participate in the deployment and recovery of the instrumentation offshore New Zealand. He/she will analyze the collected data by designing and implementing data processing tools combined with modern, statistical learning-based methods to investigate these problems.

The application deadline for the [PhD position](/files/Advertisement_PhD_2022.pdf) is January 31, 2022, with a start date in September 2022.

All inquiries and application packages should be directed to Prof. Pascal Audet (he/him) at pascal.audet@uottawa.ca
